# Donation
One Future Unified Team currently provides multiple methods for everyone to donate to and support us. Each donation, no matter if it is $1 or $10, it means a lot to us. It means our project had been loved by someone. We had worked day and night in this project and are very excited to see someone likes and would support the team.  

We currently provides two methods for everyone to support us, through <a href="https://github.com/Jst-Tan">Jst Tan</a>'s Buy Me A Coffee and Ko-Fi. You could leave a public messages to us too.
