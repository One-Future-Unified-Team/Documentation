# About
Software and Website Developer Team is an indie team consisting of four members founded by a group of teens. We are a tech focused team, mainly in software and website. Our main focus would like to build a better place on the internet where users have rights to their privacy. 

Software and Website Developer Team main goal is to return users' privacy rights back to our users. Everyone should have their privacy back in their own hands in neither the real world nor the internet so we would like to make this happen. 

Software and Website Developer Team currently has multiple projects. All projects are fully open source too so everyone could study, learn and revealed our official source code. 

Software and Website Developer Team was founded by Jst Tan and Lim Wei Bing on February 21 2022. Jst Tan and Lim Wei Bing currently owns and maintains most of the team.
